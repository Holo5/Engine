# Documentation & explanations

## Aim of the project
Use PIXI with advantages & without cons. Instanciate many graphics with an integrated assets manager who can load assets and send it to the 
graphics synchronously.

I try to recreate (from asynchronously pattern) a fully 2D engine working like a C++ engine: with a big while:
- Check entry events (keyboard, mouse, ect)
- Check several things
- Update all objects
- Draw
- Retry
